## Currently Working On
Researching neural computation and the application of neuron simulations for learning tasks.
Also various Haskell projects.

## Currently Learning
Neuroscience, and how to make better coffee.

## Looking to Collaborate On
A paper about why Microsoft Word is a terrible piece of software.

## Looking for Help With
Acquiring a large amount of processing power for training models.

## Ask Me About
Neural computation, Haskell (and category theory), and machine learning in general.

## How to Reach Me
Your arms are pretty useful for that.

## Pronouns
They/Them.

## Fun Facts
If you have called a multinational corporation sometime in the last 5 years then there's a very small chance a piece of software I wrote categorized that phone call.
